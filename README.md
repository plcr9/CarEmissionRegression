# CarEmissionRegression

This basic python program allows the user to draw upon Car Emission Data in a CSV file to conduct multiple regression analysis.

To be able to run the regression analysis, install sklearn locally using the command pip3 install -U scikit-learn.

The analysis compares the weight and volume of the car with the level of its CO2 emissions.
